# Moringa_Assesment
Moringa is looking to improve itâ€™s module-to-module retention rates for its Software
Development programme. Students enrolled in the programme must complete 5 modules in
this order: Intro to Software Development, Angular, Java/Python, Android/Django and
Professional Development.
To improve retention, we would need to find out why students may be dropping out between
modules even when they pass their prerequisite modules. And to help us do this, we have
collected performance and engagement metrics for a randomly selected Software Development
class.
